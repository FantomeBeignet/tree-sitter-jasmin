(* Semantics of an export function
FIXME: this is mostly independent of the architecture and may be partially moved to arch_sem

  - The function exists and is “export”
  - Execution runs from the initial state to the final state
  - Callee-saved registers are preserved

TODO: arguments / results are well-typed
